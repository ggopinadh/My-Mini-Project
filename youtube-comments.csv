Quentin,"I like that latte example. I also subscribed to your channel--you have my support! Another interesting thing about APIs is they don't always need to be public-facing. For example, if a company wants to build a really complex application they can divide up the developers into teams to work on separate segments of the app. The teams have to define their 'scope' and a 'use case diagram' for their part of the app so the other dev teams know how to interact with it. Then, in the end you have a fully integrated, complex app that can be easily maintained. Components can be swapped out as long as they adhere to the API rules and without affecting the rest of the application.",2020-02-05T00:57:23Z,8,3
IT k Funde,Thanks Meghna for your valuable feedback I will defintely make something on APIs in future.  Do checkout my other videos it may help.  Spread the word ! Cheers Anshul,2020-04-22T23:38:39Z,0,
